Hi, I am Alejandro, a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with
experience in the finance sector.

My academic background includes a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, a 
Big Data minor that I had the opportunity to study in the Netherlands and a
Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence.

For the last 5 years I have worked on projects related to finance, researching
currency overlay solutions and developing advanced trading models. I have also
worked utilizing quantum-inspired algorithms to solve well-known financial
problems like Index Tracking and arbitrage strategies.

In this blog I share some thoughts and ideas that I think are interesting.
